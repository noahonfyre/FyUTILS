# Installation
There are some different installation steps depending on the software you have and the environment you in.

## Stable installation
For the default installation, you should have a profile with administrator privileges.

Download the [Installer File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS/master/installer/installer.exe),
run it and follow any further steps inside the installer.

## Pure installation
If you don't have administrator privileges, you should use this installation.

Go to the [Releases Section](https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS/releases) and download the `fy.exe` file of the latest release.
After it has downloaded, move the file anywhere, you can access it from very easily.
Normally it should be in a directory in %PATH%, but this isn't possible without administrator privileges in most cases.

## Compile yourself
You can also compile everything yourself by installing [Golang](https://go.dev/dl),
cloning the repository using `git clone NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS` and build using `go build -o fy.exe`.

Copy the `fy.exe` file to the location `%userprofile%\.fy\` and add the location to your PATH environment variable.

## Nitro/Scorpion installation
Further installation steps will be listed here after the release of a Nitro and Scorpion version.

# First launch
After you installed FyUTILS, open up your command prompt and run the `fy` command to launch FyUTILS.
FyUTILS may take some more time to start on its first launch because it has to configure some stuff.
