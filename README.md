# Disclaimer
Hacking is illegal.

You'll be responsible for everything you do with this tool.

# Installation
There are some different installation steps depending on the software you have and the environment you in.

## Default installation
For the default installation, you should have a profile with administrator privileges.
This is also for you if you don't have any software like 
[Nitro](https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/nitro) or 
[Scorpion](https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/scorpion) installed.

Download the [Installer File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS/master/installer/installer.exe),
run it and follow any further steps inside the installer.

## Pure installation
If you have a profile without administrator privileges, this installation is the right one for you.

Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS/releases) and download the `fy.exe` file of the latest release.
After it has downloaded, move the file anywhere, you can access it from very easily.
Normally it should be in a directory in %PATH%, but this isn't possible without administrator privileges in most cases.

## Nitro/Sapphire installation
Further installation steps will be listed here after the release of the newest Nitro and Scorpion version.
