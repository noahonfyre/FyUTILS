# FyUTILS
FyUTILS is a hacking and utility tool with features such as DoS attacks and a port-scanner.

# Current information
As you know, I completely rewrote FyUTILS in another programming language called Golang, because it has better performance, better concurrency and some more
features that are just superior to python. However, the rewrite was messy and badly organized, so I've decided to rewrite it again. This time, I can skip a lot of unnecessary
stuff because I have a framework for all my applications called "gengine" which includes a lot of features, FyUTILS needs. This new version should also be a lot more lightweight.
For the moment, I won't release a version 2.0.0 because there are way too few features than I wanted for the biggest update since the release of FUELs.
