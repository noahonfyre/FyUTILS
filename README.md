# Current information
As you might know, I completely rewrote FyUTILS in another programming language called Golang,
because it has better performance, better concurrency and some more features that are just superior to python.
However, the rewrite was messy and badly organized, so I've decided to rewrite it again.
This time, I can skip a lot of unnecessary stuff because I have a framework for all my applications called "gengine"
which includes a lot of features, FyUTILS needs.
This new version should also be a lot more lightweight.
For the moment,
I won't release the new version v2.0.0
because there are way too few features than I wanted for the biggest update since the release of FUELs. 
Maybe I'll release the v2.0.0 version
after I finished developing the ARP scanner and the updating system to always provide you with the newest version.
