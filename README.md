# FyUTILS
FyUTILS is a hacking and utility tool with features such as DoS attacks and a port-scanner. [What is 2.0.0](https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS/discussions/53)?

# Disclaimer
Hacking is illegal. This tool is only made for ethical purposes like analyzing your own infrastructure. You'll be responsible for everything you do with this tool.

# Current information
As you know, we completely rewrote FyUTILS in another programming language called Golang, because it has better performance, better concurrency and some more features that are just superior to python. However, the rewrite was messy and badly organized, so we've decided to rewrite it again. This time, we can skip a lot of unnecessary stuff because we have a framework called "gengine" which includes a lot of features, FyUTILS needs. For the moment, we won't release a version 2.0.0 because there are way too few features than we wanted for the biggest update since the release of FUELs.
