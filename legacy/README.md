### Read before using legacy versions of FyUTILS!
These versions above are all legacy. A lot of them don't even work without removing certain line of code.
The most of them have a old version formatting (v8.0 or STABLE-1.5), that is not supported anymore.
FyUTILS is now using the "Semantic Versioning" method, to publish versions.

WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOU TO USE THE NEWEST VERSION OF FYUTILS.
